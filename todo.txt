- Resizing should work (lol)
- Save changes to file
- Render font regardless of size (different images?)
- Blinking cursor
- Copy / paste
- Cursor scrolls screen if going above or below it
- A sort of cache, so that unchanging text doesn't re-render each frame
- Text highlighting
- Word wrapping
- Scroll bar
- Multiple cursors (long goal)
